						<p><span class="ahahahaha">lozii</span> The photo was voted as Sports Illustrated’s most iconic magazine cover of all time which signifies its importance in sports history (“‘Miracle On Ice’ ”). These Olympics took place in the midst of the Cold War, and the victory over the U.S.S.R. was a great morale booster for the American public. It was more than an Olympic upset, it was an ideological victory. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States was in a period of low patriotism, due events like the Iran Hostage Crisis and a declining economy, but the victory gave millions of Americans a reason to celebrate their country (“‘Miracle On Ice’ ”). The win gave Americans a new sense of nationalism, as the win was “as meaningful as the Berlin Airlift or the Apollo moon landing” (“U.S. Hockey Team”). Ken Morrow, one of the players, even stated that the victory was “The start of the end of the Cold War” (“U.S. Hockey Team”). 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Hollywood films, most notably the film Miracle produced by Walt Disney Pictures in 2004, have been created off the incredible story of The Miracle on Ice (“Miracle”).
