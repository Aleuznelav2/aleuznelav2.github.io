						<p class="main-text-title">"The Greatest Upset in Sports History"</p>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This picture was taken at the 1980’s Olympics hosted in Lake Placid, New York, at the conclusion of a much-anticipated hockey match between the United States and the 4-time defending gold medalists Soviet Union (citation). In what would go down as one of the most improbable upsets of all time, the much younger (average age on the team was 21) and inexperienced American squad bested the older, more experienced Soviet squad, 4-3 (citation). During a period of national division, what some call “The Greatest Upset in Sports History” became a source of pride and national unity for the American public (citation). This picture was taken by Heinz Kluetmeier, who was a photographer for Sports Illustrated magazine (citation). It is the only SI cover ever that does not contain any supporting text, because it didn’t need to. As Kluetmeier stated “It didn’t need [a caption]. Everyone in America knew what happened” (“‘Miracle on Ice’”).</p>
