						<p class="main-text-title">"The Greatest Upset in Sports History"</p>
						<p class="main-text-justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This picture was taken at the 1980’s Olympics hosted in Lake Placid, New York, at the conclusion of a much-anticipated hockey match between the United States and the 4-time defending gold medalists Soviet Union (“Lake Placid 1980 Olympic Winter Games.”). In what would go down as one of the most improbable upsets of all time, the much younger (average age on the team was 21) and inexperienced American squad bested the older, more experienced Soviet squad, 4-3(“Player Roster.”). During a period of national division, what some call “The Greatest Upset in Sports History” became a source of pride and national unity for the American public (Klopman). This picture was taken by Heinz Kluetmeier, who was a photographer for Sports Illustrated magazine (Swift). It is the only SI cover ever that does not contain any supporting text, because it didn’t need to. As Kluetmeier stated “It didn’t need [a caption]. Everyone in America knew what happened” (“‘Miracle on Ice’”)
	The game was a nail biter. The Soviets scored first with a goal from Valery Krotov. The Americans answered with a goal from Buzz Schneider to tie the game 1-1 at 14:03 in the first period. Sergei Makarov gave the soviets a 2-1 lead after he scored another goal late in the first period. Then, with only one second left in the first period, Mark Johnson put a goal past veteran Soviet goalie Vladislav Tretiak. The second period was dominated by the soviets, who put another tally on the board with a goal from Alexander Maltsev. Mark Johnson scored the third American goal on a power play in the third period, assisted by Silk. Then, with only 10 minutes left in the game, Mike Eruzione scored the fourth and final goal, assisted by Pavelich and John Harrington, to make the score 4-3 and to give the Americans their first lead of the game (“Miracle on Ice - History”). As the period came to a close, and the Soviets were turned away again and again by Jim Craig (who save 36 of 39 shots for an outstanding 92.3% save percentage). As the clock hit zero, announcer Al Michael delivered his famous line “Do you believe in miracles? Yes!” while the American players jumped around on the ice in celebration. (“U.S. Hockey Team”)
