						<p class="main-text-title">Immediate Impact</p>
						<p class="main-text-justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underdog American team had upset the Soviet team, who had won the last 4 winter Olympic games in ice hockey (“All Living”). No one could believe what happened. Eruzione’s father states that he “almost slapped [his] wife off her chair” after his son scored the game winning goal (Shapiro). The Americans had asserted their dominance over a sport in which the Soviets were most proud of (Leonard).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the team still had games to play, as the finals were a round-robin style tournament instead of the current single-elimination tournament setting. There was one more day of the Winter Games, and the Americans needed to beat Finland for the gold. Herb Brooks thought of all the potential outcomes of the games that would not let the Americans win gold, and Janaszak recalled “His speech before the Finland game was negative, but the impact was positive” (Coffey 254). 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Soviets felt the exact opposite of the Americans. The team believed that they would just walk over the Americans and take gold for the 5th Olympics in a row. After placing second, many of the players refused to have their names inscribed on the medal, which is an Olympic tradition. Many of them did not even keep their medal, such as Sergei Makarov, who said “I don’t have it. I think it is in garbage in Lake Placid Jail” when asked about the whereabouts of his medal (Coffey 259). 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Soviets reacted to the disappointment in different ways. Head coach Viktor Tikhonov singled out four players- Vladimir Petrov, Vladislav Tretiak, Boris Mikhailov and Valery Kharlamov- and screamed “This is your loss! This is your loss!” Many players also turned to alcohol to help them cope, and after the games, “121 empty vodka bottles [were found] in the drop ceilings of the Soviet units.” (Anderson).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Soviet players were not the only ones that expected them to win. Their whole country, especially the Soviet politicians who realized the Cold War implications of the American Upset, were just as disappointed in the players as they were. Many of the players even believed that the politicians “almost wanted to kill [the players]” (Coffey 260). </p>
